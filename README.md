# In Memory File System in Rust

This is a separate test repo for RustPOSIX of Lind. It contains the implementation of in memory file system in Rust. Several popular used Rust API like `readat` / `writeat` / etc. have been replaced with in memory file system. The project comes with tests in different scenarios. More implementaiton / feature details will be added after the whole project has been finished. 

For test:

`cargo run -- --run-tests`

NOTE: this is an ongoing project, and bug is fixing in the process.
